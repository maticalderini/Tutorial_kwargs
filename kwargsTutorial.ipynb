You might have seen ```*args``` and ```*kwargs``` being used in other people's code or maybe on the documentation of your favourite libraries. You might have already looked for simple explanations, but all the tutorials you found were as consistenly confusing as the subject itself.\n",

    "While my explanation of ```**kwargs``` for plotting in the afore-plugged post, was sufficient for the purposes of that post (at least I certainly hope so!), I have been asked to release the sequel (prequel?) post where I more thoroughly go through the famous ```*args``` and ```**kwargs``` in an intuitive, step-by-step fashion so you won't need another tutorial about them ever again. I hope that by the end of the post, you'll see that they are actually extremely simple operators and you'll be able to start putting them into all of your functions right away to make them more flexible, simpler to use and easier to read.\n",
